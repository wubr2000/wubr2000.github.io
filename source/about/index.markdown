Welcome to this tiny outpost of the immense webiverse! My name is Bruno Wu, the sole owner and proprietor of this electronic establishment. Here, I'll be serving you some of my musings on programming, web development, and data science. And if you're still hungry for more, you can nibble on some of the [projects](../portfolio) I've worked on in the past.

Bon Appetite!
