In the fourth week at Zipfian, we encountered and implemented a few more basic machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. One of the more interesting ones for me is the *decision tree*. The decision tree is quite an appealing classification tool because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and interpretability.

Entropy function:

$$H(y) =  -\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(c_i)\log_2(P(c_i))$$
