## Problem

Our steak purchasing group needed a website for communication. We were using email to communicate our buy orders as well as to discuss steak-related opinion. This was fine when there were only a few people involved but as the group expanded, emails as a form of communication became unwieldy and someone suggested to create a website for handling purchase order as well as a forum for discussions.

## Solution

[Beefcrazy](http://beefcrazy.herokuapp.com) is a private, invite-only order management system and bloggin website.

## Lessons

- Created a sign-up, verification, log in system using Ruby on Rails
- Created a basic data model for blogging using MongoDB
